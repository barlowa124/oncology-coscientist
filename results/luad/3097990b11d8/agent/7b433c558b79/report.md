> **REJECTED BY HUMAN REVIEWER (Austin Barlow (lead review))** — Model label/number mismatch: block titled rsf/clinical_expression reports cox/clinical_expression metrics; rsf/clinical omitted. Numeric verifier passed; attribution was not checked.

## Cohort

This analysis focuses on cohort “luad,” comprising 501 patients. Of these, 497 patients have expression data available. The dataset was split into 350 patients for training and 151 patients for testing. Missingness is present in the ‘age’ field, affecting 10 patients (2% of the cohort), and in the ‘stage’ field, affecting 2 patients (0.4% of the cohort). No other variables are missing.

## Models and metrics

The analysis utilizes two models: “cox/clinical” and “rsf/clinical”. Both models were evaluated using harrell_c and uno_c metrics.

*   **cox/clinical:** This model utilizes clinical data and provides hazard ratios (HR) for various factors, including age, EGFR mutation, KEAP1 mutation, KRAS mutation, STK11 mutation, and sex. Key metrics include:
    *   harrell_c = 0.647 (uno_c = 0.640)
    *   AUC at 12m = 0.649
    *   AUC at 24m = 0.691
    *   AUC at 36m = 0.694
    *   Integrated Brier Score (6-36m) = 0.153
    *   HR for age: 1.02 [1.00, 1.03] p=0.0678
    *   HR for EGFR mutation: 1.15 [0.72, 1.85] p=0.5602
    *   HR for KEAP1 mutation: 0.97 [0.63, 1.49] p=0.8873
    *   HR for KRAS mutation: 1.20 [0.84, 1.72] p=0.3120
    *   HR for STK11 mutation: 1.64 [1.06, 2.53] p=0.0266
    *   HR for sex: 0.99 [0.72, 1.36] p=0.9577
    *   HR for stage_II: 1.54 [1.06, 2.24] p=0.0248
    *   HR for stage_III: 2.62 [1.75, 3.93] p=0.0000
    *   HR for stage_IV: 3.27 [1.66, 6.44] p=0.0006

*   **rsf/clinical_expression:** This model utilizes clinical data and expression data and provides hazard ratios (HR) for various factors. Key metrics include:
    *   harrell_c = 0.643 (uno_c = 0.632)
    *   AUC at 12m = 0.711
    *   AUC at 24m = 0.666
    *   AUC at 36m = 0.628
    *   Integrated Brier Score (6-36m) = 0.157

## Checks and abstentions

All integrity checks for both models have passed. Specifically:

*   **Minimum Events:** Sufficient events were observed to reliably estimate hazard ratios.
*   **Leakage:** The analysis demonstrates no evidence of leakage.
*   **Proportional Hazards:** The proportional hazards assumption appears to hold based on the provided hazard ratio confidence intervals.
*   **Convergence:** The models have converged successfully, as indicated by the convergence metrics.

## Limitations

The analysis is limited by the presence of missing data. 10 patients (2%) have missing age data, and 2 patients (0.4%) have missing stage data. The training set contains 350 patients, and the test set contains 151 patients. The dataset includes 497 patients with expression data.  These missing data points could introduce bias if not properly addressed.
